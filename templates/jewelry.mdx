## Template Setup Tips

<Tip>
**Start with a real example**: Browse the real-world examples above to see how successful jewelry stores structure their customizers. This helps you understand customer expectations.
</Tip>

<Warning>
**Character limits are important**: Always set appropriate character limits for engraving to ensure text fits properly on the jewelry piece. Typical limits are 15-20 characters per line.
</Warning>

### Best Practices

**Use conditional logic**: Show engraving options only when customers select "Add Engraving" to keep the interface clean.

**Provide font previews**: Use Font Swatch option type to show customers exactly how their text will look in different fonts.

**Set clear expectations**: Include information about production time, engraving limitations, and return policies for personalized items.

**Enable live preview**: Jewelry customers want to see exactly what they're ordering. Enable live preview to show engraved text on product images.
