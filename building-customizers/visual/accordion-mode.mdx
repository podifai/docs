## Overview

Every option type in Podifai supports **Accordion Mode**, which displays options in a collapsible, space-saving layout. This is perfect for customizers with many options or when you want to guide customers through choices step-by-step.

## What is Accordion Mode?

Accordion Mode presents options in expandable/collapsible sections. Only one section is visible at a time (or multiple, depending on your settings), helping customers focus on one choice at a time.

**Benefits:**
- **Saves Space**: Reduces visual clutter on product pages
- **Improves Focus**: Customers concentrate on one option at a time
- **Better Mobile Experience**: Ideal for smaller screens
- **Guided Selection**: Creates a step-by-step customization flow

## Accordion vs Standard Mode

### Standard Mode
- All options visible at once
- Requires more vertical space
- Best for simple customizers with few options
- Faster for customers who know what they want

### Accordion Mode
- Options hidden until expanded
- Compact and organized
- Best for complex customizers with many options
- Guides customers through the selection process

## Supported Option Types

**All option types support Accordion Mode:**

- Image Swatch
- Color Swatch
- Font Swatch
- Dropdown
- Badge Group
- Text Input
- Text Area
- Image Upload

<Note>
Accordion Mode is a display setting, not a separate option type. You can toggle any option type between Standard and Accordion modes.

## Accordion Settings

### Expand Behavior

**Single Expand** (Recommended)
- Only one accordion section open at a time
- Opening a new section closes the previous one
- Creates a guided, step-by-step experience

**Multiple Expand**
- Multiple sections can be open simultaneously
- Customers can compare options more easily
- Requires more scrolling

### Default State

**First Section Open**
- The first option is expanded by default
- Guides customers to start with the first choice
- Recommended for most use cases

**All Closed**
- All sections start collapsed
- Customers must click to see options
- Good for advanced users or optional customizations

**All Open**
- All sections start expanded
- Similar to Standard mode but with collapse capability
- Useful when you want accordion structure but immediate visibility

## Design Customization

### Accordion Header

Customize the appearance of accordion headers:

- **Header Background**: Choose from color shades (e.g., `bg100`)
- **Header Text**: Set color and size
- **Expand Icon**: Customize the expand/collapse indicator
- **Border**: Add or remove borders between sections

### Accordion Content

Customize the expanded content area:

- **Content Background**: Usually lighter than header (e.g., `bg50`)
- **Padding**: Adjust spacing inside the accordion
- **Animation**: Set expand/collapse animation speed

## Best Practices
