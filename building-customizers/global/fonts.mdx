## Overview

Podifai allows you to set a global font that applies to all text in your customizers. You can choose from built-in fonts, inherit fonts from your Shopify theme, or upload custom fonts for a unique brand experience.

## Font Source Options

Podifai supports three font sources:

### 1. Built-in Fonts (Google Fonts)

Choose from a curated selection of popular Google Fonts that are optimized for web use.

**Popular Options:**
- **Inter** (Default) - Modern, clean, highly readable
- **Roboto** - Friendly and professional
- **Open Sans** - Neutral and versatile
- **Lato** - Warm and approachable
- **Montserrat** - Geometric and modern
- **Poppins** - Geometric with personality
- **Plus many more...**

<Note>
Built-in fonts load quickly and are optimized for performance across all devices.
</Note>

### 2. Shopify Theme Fonts

Inherit the font family from your Shopify theme to maintain perfect consistency with your store's design.

**Benefits:**
- Automatic matching with your store's branding
- No additional font loading required
- Seamless integration with your theme

**When to Use:**
- You want customizers to match your store exactly
- Your theme uses a premium or custom font
- You're concerned about page load performance

<Tip>
This is the recommended option for most stores as it ensures visual consistency.
</Tip>

### 3. Upload Custom Fonts

**Supported Formats:**
- `.ttf` (TrueType Font)
- `.otf` (OpenType Font)
- `.woff` (Web Open Font Format)

### Font File Requirements

- **Maximum file size**: 5 MB
- **Recommended formats**: .woff or .ttf for best compatibility
- **License**: Ensure you have web use rights for the font

<Warning>
Make sure you have the legal right to use any custom font on your website. Unlicensed font use can result in legal issues.
</Warning>

## Font Weights and Styles

### Available Weights

Depending on your chosen font, you may have access to multiple weights:

- **Thin** (100)
- **Extra Light** (200)
- **Light** (300)
- **Regular** (400) - Default
- **Medium** (500)
- **Semi Bold** (600)
- **Bold** (700)
- **Extra Bold** (800)
- **Black** (900)

<Note>
Not all fonts support all weights. Built-in Google Fonts typically offer multiple weights, while custom fonts depend on what's included in the font file.
</Note>

### Font Styles

- **Normal** - Standard upright text
- **Italic** - Slanted text for emphasis

## Best Practices

### Readability First

Choose fonts that are easy to read at various sizes. Avoid overly decorative fonts for body text.

**Good for body text:**
- Inter, Roboto, Open Sans, Lato

**Good for headings:**
- Montserrat, Poppins, Raleway, Playfair Display

### Performance Considerations

**Font Loading Impact:**
- **Built-in fonts**: Fast, optimized loading
- **Theme fonts**: No additional load (already loaded)
- **Custom fonts**: Adds to page load time

<Tip>
If using custom fonts, optimize your font files by removing unused characters and weights to reduce file size.
</Tip>

### Brand Consistency

Match your font choice to your brand personality:

| Brand Type | Recommended Fonts |
|------------|-------------------|
| Modern Tech | Inter, Roboto, Manrope |
| Luxury | Playfair Display, Cormorant, Cinzel |
| Friendly | Poppins, Quicksand, Nunito |
| Professional | Lato, Source Sans, Work Sans |
| Creative | Montserrat, Raleway, Josefin Sans |
