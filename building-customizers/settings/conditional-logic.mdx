**Conditional Logic** allows you to create dynamic, interactive customizers by showing or hiding options based on your customers' previous selections. This creates a more streamlined and personalized experience.

## Why Use Conditional Logic?

Conditional logic helps you:

-   Simplify complex customizers by showing only relevant options
-   Guide customers through the customization process
-   Reduce confusion by hiding options that don't apply
-   Create product bundles or add-ons that appear conditionally

## How Conditional Logic Works

Conditional logic uses "if-then" rules. For example:

-   **If** a customer selects "Engraving" → **Then** show the "Engraving Text" input field
-   **If** a customer chooses "Gift Wrap" → **Then** show the "Gift Message" option

## Setting Up Conditional Logic

1.  In the option set editor, select the option you want to make conditional.
2.  Click on the **Conditional Logic** tab.
3.  Click **Add Rule**.
4.  Choose the condition: "Show this option if..." or "Hide this option if..."
5.  Select the triggering option and its value.
6.  Save your changes.

*Configure rules to show or hide options based on customer selections.*

## Example Use Cases

### Example 1: Engraving Option

Show the "Engraving Text" input only if the customer selects "Yes" for "Add Engraving?"

**Rule**: Show "Engraving Text" if "Add Engraving?" equals "Yes"

### Example 2: Gift Wrapping

Show gift wrapping options only if the customer selects "This is a gift"

**Rule**: Show "Gift Wrap Style" if "Is this a gift?" equals "Yes"

### Example 3: Premium Materials

Show premium material options only if the customer selects a specific product variant

**Rule**: Show "Premium Leather" if "Material" equals "Leather"

## Best Practices

<Tip>
Use conditional logic sparingly to avoid creating overly complex customizers that are difficult for customers to navigate.
</Tip>

<Note>
Test your conditional logic thoroughly to ensure options appear and disappear as expected.
</Note>

## Advanced Conditional Logic

You can create more complex rules by combining multiple conditions:

-   **AND** logic: Show an option only if multiple conditions are met
-   **OR** logic: Show an option if any of several conditions are met

For example: Show "Express Shipping" if "Order Value" is greater than $100 **AND** "Location" equals "USA"
