A **Product Customizer** is the collection of custom options you configure for a specific product. Each product in your Shopify store can have its own customizer with unique options.

## How Product Customizers Work

In Podifai, customizers are created directly on products. When you click "Add Options" on a product, you're creating a customizer for that specific product. The customizer contains all the options you want to offer for personalization.

For example, a "Personalized Necklace" customizer might include:

-   Metal finish (Color Swatch)
-   Engraving text (Text Input)
-   Number of pendants (Dropdown)

## Creating Your First Customizer

1.  From the Podifai **Products** page, find the product you want to customize.
2.  Click the **Add Options** button.
3.  You'll be taken to the visual editor where you can add and configure options.

*Click "Add Options" to start building your customizer.*

## Adding Options to Your Customizer

Once you're in the editor, you can add options from the left sidebar:

1.  Click on the **Options** tab in the left sidebar.
2.  Browse the available option types organized by category:
    -   **Select**: Image Swatch, Color Swatch, Font Swatch, Dropdown, Badge Group
    -   **Inputs**: Text Input, Text Area, Image Upload
    -   **Presentation**: Text Display
3.  Click on an option type to add it to your customizer.
4.  Configure the option properties in the right sidebar.

Repeat this process to add as many options as you need.

## Organizing Your Options

You can reorder your options to control the sequence in which they appear on the product page:

1.  Switch to the **My Layers** tab in the left sidebar.
2.  Drag and drop options to reorder them.
3.  The order here reflects the order on your product page.

## Option Properties

Each option has configurable properties in the right sidebar:

### General Settings

-   **Display type**: Choose between Standard (always visible) or Collapsible (accordion style)
-   **Label value**: The name shown to customers
-   **Placeholder**: Hint text for input fields
-   **Required field**: Whether customers must complete this option

### Help Text (Standard mode only)

-   **Hint**: A clickable label (e.g., "Size guide", "Color guide")
-   **Value**: The detailed help text that appears when clicked

### Selection Requirements

For options with multiple values:
-   **Allow multiple option values**: Let customers select more than one value
-   **Min selections**: Minimum number of selections required
-   **Max selections**: Maximum number of selections allowed

### Pricing

-   **Price**: Enable additional pricing for this option
-   **Additional Price**: The extra amount to add when this option has a value

## Saving Your Customizer

After configuring your options:

1.  Click the **Save** button in the header.
2.  Your customizer is saved and will appear on your product page once the app is activated.

<Tip>
Changes are saved immediately when you click Save. There's no separate publish step needed.
</Tip>

## Managing Existing Customizers

To edit a customizer you've already created:

1.  Go to the **Products** page.
2.  Find the product with the customizer (shown as "Added" status).
3.  Click the **Edit Options** button.
4.  Make your changes in the editor.
5.  Click **Save** to update.

## Using Templates

If you're creating similar customizers for multiple products, you can use templates:

1.  When clicking "Add Options" on a new product, you'll see available templates.
2.  Select a template to start with pre-configured options.
3.  Customize the options as needed for your specific product.
4.  Click **Save** to apply.

<Note>
Templates provide a starting point but create an independent customizer for each product. Changes to one product's customizer don't affect others.
</Note>

## Best Practices

<Tip>
Use clear, descriptive labels for your options to help customers understand their choices.
</Tip>

<Tip>
Group related options together by ordering them logically in My Layers.
</Tip>

<Tip>
Use the Collapsible display type for options with many values to keep the product page clean.
</Tip>
