An **Option Set** is the foundation of your product customizer. It's a collection of custom options that you can apply to one or more products in your Shopify store.

## What is an Option Set?

Think of an option set as a template for customization. It contains all the options you want to offer for a specific product or group of products. For example, a "Jewelry Engraving" option set might include:

-   Metal finish (Color Swatch)
-   Engraving text (Text Input)
-   Number of discs (Dropdown)

## Creating Your First Option Set

1.  From your Podifai dashboard, navigate to **Option Sets**.
2.  Click the **Create Option Set** button.
3.  Give your option set a descriptive name (e.g., "Custom T-Shirt Options").
4.  Click **Create**.

*Give your option set a clear, descriptive name.*

## Adding Options to Your Set

Once you've created an option set, you can start adding options:

1.  In the option set editor, click **Add Option**.
2.  Select the option type you want to add (e.g., Color Swatch, Text Input).
3.  Configure the option settings.
4.  Click **Save**.

Repeat this process to add as many options as you need.

## Organizing Your Options

You can drag and reorder your options to control the sequence in which they appear on the product page. Simply click and drag an option to move it up or down.

## Option Set Settings

### Display Settings

-   **Layout**: Choose between standard, accordion, or popup display
-   **Theme**: Select a pre-built theme or customize colors and fonts

### Assignment Settings

-   **Products**: Assign the option set to specific products
-   **Collections**: Apply to all products in a collection
-   **Tags**: Use product tags for automatic assignment

## Managing Multiple Option Sets

You can create multiple option sets for different product types. For example:

-   "Jewelry Customization" for rings and necklaces
-   "Apparel Options" for t-shirts and hoodies
-   "Home Decor Personalization" for pillows and wall art

## Best Practices

<Tip>
Use clear, descriptive names for your option sets to make them easy to identify and manage.

You can apply the same option set to multiple products, saving you time and ensuring consistency across your store.
