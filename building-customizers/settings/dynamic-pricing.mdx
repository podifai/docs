**Dynamic Pricing** allows you to add extra costs to your products based on the options your customers select. This is essential for offering premium customizations, add-ons, or services at an additional charge.

## Why Use Dynamic Pricing?

Dynamic pricing helps you:

-   Charge appropriately for premium materials or finishes
-   Add fees for customization services like engraving or embroidery
-   Offer add-ons and upsells that increase your average order value
-   Accurately reflect the cost of different product variations

## How Dynamic Pricing Works

When you add a price to an option, that amount is automatically added to the product's base price. The total price is displayed in real-time as the customer makes their selections, and it carries through to the cart and checkout.

## Setting Up Dynamic Pricing

1.  In the option set editor, select the option you want to add pricing to.
2.  In the option value settings, enter the additional price (e.g., +$10.00).
3.  The price will be displayed next to the option on the product page.
4.  Save your changes.

## Advanced Pricing Strategies

### Quantity-Based Pricing

You can set up pricing that changes based on the quantity selected. For example, offer a discount for bulk orders.

### Conditional Pricing

Combine dynamic pricing with conditional logic to show premium options only to customers who select specific variants.
