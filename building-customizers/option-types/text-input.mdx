The **Text Input** option type allows customers to enter short text entries, such as names, initials, or custom messages. This is perfect for personalized products like jewelry, gifts, and apparel.

## When to Use Text Input

Use the Text Input option type when you want to:

-   Offer engraving or embroidery services
-   Let customers add names or initials
-   Collect short custom messages

## How to Add a Text Input

1.  In the option set editor, click **Add Option**.
2.  Select **Text Input** from the list of option types.
3.  Give your option a name (e.g., "Engraving Text").
4.  Set a character limit to control the length of the input.
5.  Optionally, add a price for the personalization service.

## Configuration Options

### Character Limit

Set a maximum number of characters to ensure the text fits on your product. For example, jewelry engravings typically have a limit of 15-20 characters.

### Placeholder Text

Add placeholder text to guide customers on what to enter (e.g., "Enter your name here").

### Pricing

You can charge an additional fee for personalization services. For example, engraving might cost an extra $10.

## Example Use Cases

-   **Jewelry**: Engraving names, dates, or messages
-   **Apparel**: Monogramming or custom text on shirts
-   **Gifts**: Personalized messages on gift items

## Best Practices

<Tip>
Always set a character limit to ensure the text fits on your product and to manage production expectations.
