The **File Upload** option type allows customers to upload their own files, such as images, logos, or documents. This is essential for custom printing, engraving, or design services.

## When to Use File Upload

Use the File Upload option type when you want to:

-   Accept custom designs or logos from customers
-   Allow customers to upload photos for printing
-   Collect documents or files for custom orders

## How to Add a File Upload

1.  In the option set editor, click **Add Option**.
2.  Select **File Upload** from the list of option types.
3.  Give your option a name (e.g., "Upload Your Logo").
4.  Configure file type restrictions (e.g., JPG, PNG, PDF).
5.  Set a maximum file size limit.

## Configuration Options

### Accepted File Types

Specify which file types you accept (e.g., .jpg, .png, .pdf). This helps ensure you receive files in the correct format.

### File Size Limit

Set a maximum file size to prevent customers from uploading excessively large files. A typical limit is 5-10 MB.

### Pricing

You can charge an additional fee for custom file processing or printing.

## Example Use Cases

-   **Printing Services**: Custom photo prints or posters
-   **Apparel**: Custom designs for t-shirts or hoodies
-   **Jewelry**: Custom engravings based on uploaded images
-   **Gifts**: Personalized items with customer-provided photos

## Best Practices

<Tip>
Clearly communicate the file requirements (format, size, resolution) to customers to avoid issues during production.
