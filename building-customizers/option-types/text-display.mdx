The **Text Display** option type allows you to show static text, instructions, or information to customers on your product page. Unlike other option types, Text Display doesn't collect input from customers—it's purely for displaying content.

## When to Use Text Display

Use the Text Display option type when you want to:

-   Provide product care instructions
-   Show sizing guidelines or measurement tips
-   Display shipping or production time information
-   Add important notices or disclaimers
-   Include promotional messages or special offers

## How to Add a Text Display

1.  In the editor, open the **Options** tab in the left sidebar.
2.  Find **Text Display** in the "Presentation" category.
3.  Click on it to add it to your customizer.
4.  In the right sidebar, enter your text content in the **Label value** field.

## Display Types

Text Display supports two display modes:

### Standard Mode

In Standard mode, the text is always visible and expanded on the product page. This is ideal for important information that customers should see immediately.

### Collapsible (Accordion) Mode

In Collapsible mode, the text is hidden behind a clickable header that customers can expand. This keeps the product page clean while still making information accessible.

To switch between modes:
1.  Select your Text Display option.
2.  In the right sidebar, find **Display type**.
3.  Choose either **Standard** or **Collapsible**.

## Configuration Options

### Label Value

The main text content to display. This can include:
-   Product instructions
-   Care guidelines
-   Important notices
-   Any informational text

### Conditional Logic

You can use [conditional logic](/building-customizers/settings/conditional-logic) to show or hide the Text Display based on other option selections. For example, show care instructions only when a customer selects a specific material.

## Example Use Cases

### Product Care Instructions

Display care and cleaning instructions for your products:

> **Care Instructions**: Hand wash only with mild soap. Do not use harsh chemicals. Dry with a soft cloth.

### Sizing Information

Provide helpful sizing guidance:

> **Sizing Tip**: This item runs small. We recommend ordering one size up for a comfortable fit.

### Production Time Notice

> **Please Note**: Custom engraved items require 5-7 business days for production before shipping.

### Material Information

Share details about materials used:

> **Material**: This piece is crafted from 925 Sterling Silver with a rhodium finish for added durability.

## Best Practices

<Tip>
Use Collapsible mode for longer text content to keep your product page clean and organized.
</Tip>

<Tip>
Place Text Display options strategically—put important notices near the top and supplementary information lower down.
</Tip>

<Tip>
Keep text concise and scannable. Use short paragraphs and bullet points when possible.
</Tip>

<Note>
Text Display options don't affect pricing or require customer input. They're purely informational.
</Note>

## Combining with Other Options

Text Display works well alongside other option types to provide context:

-   Add care instructions after material selection options
-   Show engraving guidelines above text input fields
-   Display size charts near size selection dropdowns
-   Include shipping notes after all customization options
