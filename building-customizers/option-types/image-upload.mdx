## Best Practices

<Tip>
Clearly communicate the image requirements (format, resolution, dimensions) to customers using the Help Text feature.
</Tip>

<Tip>
Use conditional logic to show the Image Upload option only when relevant. For example, show it only when customers select "Add Custom Image" option.
</Tip>

<Warning>
Always review uploaded images before production to ensure they meet your quality standards and are appropriate for your products.
</Warning>

<Note>
High-resolution images work best for printing. Consider adding guidelines about minimum dimensions (e.g., "Please upload images at least 300 DPI or 1000x1000 pixels").
