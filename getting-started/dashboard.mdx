The **Dashboard** is your command center for monitoring the performance of your product customizers. It provides key analytics to help you understand how Podifai is contributing to your store's revenue.

## Accessing the Dashboard

The Dashboard is the first page you see when you open the Podifai app. You can also access it by clicking **Dashboard** in the left navigation menu.

## Analytics Overview

### Total Revenue by Podifai

This shows the cumulative revenue generated from orders that included Podifai customizations. This includes:

-   Base product prices for customized products
-   Additional charges from dynamic pricing options

### Revenue by Podifai This Month

This displays the revenue generated from customized orders in the current calendar month. Use this to track monthly performance and identify trends.

### Total Number of Orders by Podifai

## Understanding Your Metrics

These metrics help you answer important questions:

-   **Is customization popular?** Compare Podifai orders to your total store orders.
-   **Are premium options selling?** If revenue per order is higher than your average product price, customers are choosing paid customizations.
-   **Is there a trend?** Compare this month's numbers to previous months to identify growth patterns.

## Data Updates

Analytics data is updated in real-time as orders are placed. When you refresh the Dashboard or navigate back to it, you'll see the latest numbers.

<Note>
Only orders that include products with Podifai customizations are counted in these metrics. Regular orders without customizations are not included.
