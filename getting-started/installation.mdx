## Initial Setup

Once the app is installed, you will be guided through a brief onboarding process. This may include connecting your store and choosing a default theme for your customizers.

## Verifying the Installation

To ensure that Podifai is working correctly on your store, you can create a test option set and assign it to a product. If the customizer appears on the product page, the installation was successful.
