This guide will walk you through creating your first product customizer from scratch. By the end of this tutorial, you'll have a fully functional customizer live on your Shopify store.

## What You'll Build

In this tutorial, you'll create a simple jewelry engraving customizer that allows customers to:

-   Choose a metal finish (e.g., Gold, Silver, Rose Gold)
-   Enter custom engraving text
-   Select the number of discs

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

-   Installed the Podifai app on your Shopify store
-   At least one product in your Shopify store that you want to add the customizer to

## Step 1: Select Your Product

1.  Open the Podifai app from your Shopify admin.
2.  You'll see the **Products** page with all your Shopify products listed.
3.  Find the product you want to customize (e.g., "Custom Engraved Necklace").
4.  Click the **Add Options** button next to the product.

*Click "Add Options" to open the customizer editor.*

## Step 2: Add a Color Swatch Option

You'll now be in the visual editor. Let's add a color swatch for the metal finish.

1.  In the left sidebar, click on the **Options** tab.
2.  Find **Color Swatch** in the "Select" category.
3.  Click on it to add it to your customizer (or drag it to the canvas).
4.  In the right sidebar, configure the option:
    -   **Label value**: "Metal Finish"
    -   **Required field**: Toggle on
5.  Click the **+** button next to "Option values" to add colors.
6.  Configure each color option:
    -   Gold (#FFD700)
    -   Silver (#C0C0C0)
    -   Rose Gold (#B76E79)

*Configure the color swatch with your desired colors in the right panel.*

## Step 3: Add a Text Input Option

Now let's add a text input for the engraving text.

1.  In the left sidebar **Options** tab, find **Text Input** in the "Inputs" category.
2.  Click on it to add it to your customizer.
3.  In the right sidebar, configure the option:
    -   **Label value**: "Engraving Text"
    -   **Placeholder**: "Enter your text here"
    -   **Required field**: Toggle on
    -   **Allow Character Limit**: Toggle on
    -   **Max character**: 20

*Set a character limit to control the length of the engraving.*

## Step 4: Add a Dropdown Option

Finally, let's add a dropdown for the number of discs.

1.  In the left sidebar **Options** tab, find **Dropdown** in the "Select" category.
2.  Click on it to add it to your customizer.
3.  In the right sidebar, configure the option:
    -   **Label value**: "Number of Discs"
    -   **Required field**: Toggle on
4.  Add three option values:
    -   One
    -   Two
    -   Three

*A dropdown is perfect for a limited set of choices.*

## Step 5: Review in My Layers

Switch to the **My Layers** tab in the left sidebar to see all your options listed. You can:

-   **Reorder** options by dragging them up or down
-   **Duplicate** an option by clicking the copy icon
-   **Delete** an option by clicking the trash icon

![Review your options in My Layers](/images/screenshots/first-customizer/my-layers.png)
*My Layers shows all your options and lets you reorder them.*

## Step 6: Save Your Customizer

Once you're happy with your options:

1.  Click the **Save** button in the header.
2.  Your customizer is now saved and ready to be activated.

*Click Save to save your customizer configuration.*

## Step 7: Activate the App

If this is your first customizer, you'll need to activate the Podifai app embed:

1.  Click **Next** at the bottom of the editor.
2.  Follow the instructions to enable the app embed in your Shopify theme.
3.  Once activated, your customizer will be live on your product page.

*Enable the app embed to make your customizers visible on your store.*

<Tip>
You only need to activate the app embed once. After that, all customized products will automatically display their customizers.
