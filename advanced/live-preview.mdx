**Live Preview** will enable you to see exactly how customer selections appear in real-time as they customize your products. This feature is shown as "Coming Soon" in the editor.

## Current Preview Capabilities

While the interactive Live Preview feature is coming soon, the editor currently provides:

The editor canvas shows a preview of your customizer as you build it:

-   See your options arranged in the order you've configured
-   View Standard and Collapsible display modes
-   Preview option layouts (grid, list, etc.)
-   See color and styling changes

### Option Properties Preview

When configuring options in the right sidebar:

-   Option values are displayed as you add them
-   Layout changes update on the canvas
-   Display type changes (Standard/Collapsible) are reflected immediately

## Planned Live Preview Features

When released, the full Live Preview will include:

### Interactive Preview

### Device Preview

Test your customizer on different screen sizes:

| Device | Width | Use Case |
|--------|-------|----------|

## Testing Your Customizer Now

Until the full Live Preview is available, here's how to test your customizer:

### 1. Save and View on Store

1.  Save your customizer in the editor.
2.  Ensure the app embed is activated.
3.  Visit your product page on your live store.
4.  Test the customizer as a customer would.

### 2. Quality Checklist

Before going live, verify on your product page:

-   All options display correctly
-   Labels are clear and readable
-   Colors match your brand
-   Conditional logic works as expected
-   Pricing updates correctly
-   Mobile layout is usable
-   Required fields show validation

## Best Practices

<Tip>
Test your customizer on your actual product page before advertising it to customers. The editor canvas shows structure, but your theme may affect final styling.
</Tip>

<Tip>
Test on multiple devices (phone, tablet, desktop) to ensure a good experience for all customers.
</Tip>

<Tip>
Test all option combinations, especially when using conditional logic, to ensure customers can complete their customizations without issues.
